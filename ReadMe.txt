This is just some quick and ugly code for testing colors and frames in block languages. The code is for being executed, not for being read.

Download the code (I think Java 1.8) and execute stefik_blocks. The code asks you to enter a username, then a seed. Before running the experiment, 
just use a dummy name for the user name and an arbitrary seed, i.e. an integer value (do not leave the seed open). Then the app starts.

You have to enter 2 times return before the experiment starts. Put your fingers on the keyboard before doing the experiments.

The app asks you what the indentation level of the marked block is. You have to press 1-5 for answering the question. Then, the app tells you
you press enter to go to the next task.

Altogether, you have to answer 400 question - it taskes about 10 minutes time.

The app saves the collected data in a csv-file, make sure before running the experiment that such file is created.

When you run the experiment, enter a username and NO SEED (it uses the predefined seed in the app). 

Then, to an ANOVA on the csv file.....
